# WLA
Windows-Linux-Android project

Project template for Windows, Linux, and Android.

Compilation for Windows and Linux can be done with Visual Studio.

Compilation for Android can be done with Android Studio.

All external assets (images, audio, fonts) must be placed inside the `assets/` folder.

The src folder is used for `.cpp`, `.h`, and optionally `.rc` files. 

The SFML directory has SFML 2.6.0 for Windows/Linux but can be changed to any other version.

The `versions/` folder is ignored by Git.

The `res/` folder is used by Android Studio for icons and styles.
