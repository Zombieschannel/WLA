# WLA
Windows-Linux-Android project

Project template for Windows, Linux, and Android.

Compilation for Windows and Linux can be done with Visual Studio.

Compilation for Android can be done with Android Studio.

## Setup

All external assets (images, audio, fonts) must be placed inside the `assets/` folder.

The `src/` folder is used for `.cpp`, `.h`, and optionally `.rc` files. 

The `SFML/` directory should have `bin/`, `include/`, and `lib` folders inside for Windows/Linux.

The `versions/` folder is ignored by Git and can be used for saving previous releases.

The `res/` folder is used by Android Studio for icons and styles.
